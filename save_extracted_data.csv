          The SEO Specialist runs the show when it comes to organic strategy at Veracity. What does that mean? It means you’re up for an exciting, even career-building chance to join a young &amp; hungry SEO team and contribute to something magical. Reporting to &amp; supported by the Digital Marketing Manager, you’ll have oodles of autonomy leading our quest to own organic rankings.<br/><br/>Working alongside 4 other humble, hungry, and smart SEO specialists, you’ll have your own group of web pages to work your SEO ninjutsu on. We’ll be counting on you to develop a holistic SEO strategy for the products in your care, and you’ll have all the fulfillment resources you need. In short, your influence is vast, and you’ll have big chances to shine. In case you were wondering, yes - that’s opportunity knocking. Better answer it.<br/><br/><strong>About Veracity Insurance<br/><br/></strong>Penicillin changed medicine. The Beatles changed music. And Veracity Insurance Solutions is changing insurance (hey, we can’t <em>all</em> be doctors and musicians). What GEICO did for home and auto insurance — well, we’re doing <em>that</em> for the world of business insurance.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, we make small business insurance simple, affordable, and buyable online without always talking to an agent. We’re growing <em>FAST</em>, and we want you to be a part of it.<br/><br/><strong>What’s In It For You<br/><br/></strong>We all need to get paid, and the budgeted range for this position is $55K-$75K DOE.<br/><br/>Veracity also offers 160 hours of PTO (sick or vacation) plus 2 floating holidays per year, a 401(k) with a company match plan, health/dental/vision plans, free mental health resources, and more. We also do regular team activities, lunches, and genuinely enjoy time with each other.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing compares to being part of explosive growth, impacting that growth personally, and working with some truly remarkable people. See what they say about working at Veracity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFeOlVg3YLg<br/><br/>Speaking of remarkable people, you out-of-towners will have the opportunity to meet the rest of the marketing team at least once a year at our annual offsite near our headquarters in<br/><br/><strong>A Day in the Life of the SEO Specialist<br/><br/></strong>If you prefer a Groundhog Day job, respawning the same level/tasks each day, this job isn’t for you. Each day is a little different for the SEO Specialist, it’s never boring, and it’ll require agility to respond to the evolving world of SEO (thanks, Google!).<br/><br/>That said, a “typical” day might include link building, website audits, keyword research, link building, helping to develop/execute content strategy, page layout/design reviews, link building, competitor analysis, consulting on site speed &amp; technical best practices, reporting, collaborating with other teams, and did we mention link building?<br/><br/><strong>What You Need To Succeed<br/><br/></strong>You obviously know the h*ck out of search engine optimization. If you eat, drink, and sleep organic search, bring what you know about successful SEO campaigns, and infuse that knowledge into our products, you’ll succeed.<br/><br/>Since you’re a search engine marketer, your project management muscles are awesome, so flex ‘em. Your flair for data analysis and using numbers as a success guide are also key.<br/><br/>Speaking of numbers, tracking KPIs and analyzing outcomes to say what worked and what didn’t will definitely come in handy. We’ll fail on the way to success, so learning and adapting are great traits.<br/><br/>You’re good at taking into account past outcomes and future forecasts, doing market research, building business cases, project plans, and SMART goals that improve organic rankings, and keeping your ear to the ground for news on industry trends and updates.<br/><br/>Above all, you’re humble, hungry, smart, and proactive. And if you’re that, you’re one of us.<br/><br/><strong>Work Schedule<br/><br/></strong>No surprises here, the expectation is a 40-hour workweek. Since you have a life outside of work, there’s flexibility when it comes to in-and-out times. You’ll work with your manager on a schedule that fits your lifestyle and the team.<br/><br/>This position can be remote, in-office, or blended (remote and in-office). You’ll also work that out with your manager. Just know we’re flexible.<br/><br/><strong>Requirements<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>2+ years of experience in roles directly managing SEO strategy &amp; execution</li><li>Proven results running national organic campaigns during your 2+ years of experience</li><li>The ability to develop a true SEO strategy</li><li>Proficiency with Google Analytics and Google Search Console</li><li>Working knowledge of various marketing tools (e.g. Moz, SEMRush, Ahrefs, etc.)</li><li>Strong project management skills</li><li>Extensive experience with content strategy development and management, either directly or in a consultative/collaborative role</li><li>Tangible experiences with building links, running technical audits, consulting on the creation of content that ranks, reporting results to stakeholders, and creating SEO strategies from scratch</li><li>Experience working in WordPress</li><li>Willingness to understand the world of insurance and insurance marketing</li><li>A humble, hungry, smart, and proactive attitude<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Preferred Skills And Experience<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Solid Excel/Google Sheets skills</li><li>Experience with data visualization tools, such as Looker Studio or Databox<br/><br/></li></ul>Salary Range: 55,000-75,000 Annually
